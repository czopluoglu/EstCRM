EstCRM_1.6 (2022-9-12)

  * CRAN errors on html manual are fixed

EstCRM_1.5 (2022-6-13)

  * Maintainer contact information is updated
  
EstCRM_1.4 (2015-7-11)

  * The previous versions of EstCRMitem function only estimated item parameters using Shojima's simplified EM algorithm. 
    Now, a new argument is added to the function such that the user can also choose Wang & Zeng's algorithm when estimating item parameters. 
    In addition, a new argument is added for the Wang & Zeng algorithm. If BFGS is TRUE, Broyden?Fletcher?Goldfarb?Shanno (BFGS) algorithm  
    is used to approximate the Hessian at each cycle. If BFGS is FALSE, Hessian is directly computed at each cycle.

  * The EstCRMitem item function is updated such that it returns the standard error of the item parameter estimates.

EstCRM_1.3 (2012-07-28)

  * Small changes are added to printing the EstCRMitem output.

EstCRM_1.2 (2012-02-2)

  * A new function bootCRM() is added to estimate the standard errors of item parameter estimates using non-parameteric bootstrap sampling

  * DESCRIPTION and Rd files are updated
  
  * A new dataset (SelfEff) and sample R codes to analyze the new dataset are added
